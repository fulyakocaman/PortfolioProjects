Assignment Number: #1 Lexical Analyzer 

The problem we are trying to solve is to parse source code into meaningful units of interpretation. We want to be able to process 
the inputted source code and output a list of recognized versus unrecognized tokens. The recognized tokens should be identified 
by their type. These token types include identifiers, integers, separators, operators, and keywords. The unrecognized tokens 
will be indicated as unknown. The output will print the token type and the associated lexeme that has been identified as such.
