# Goals:

In this assignment I used C++ language.

From the Linux terminal:
Compile the assignment3.cpp by using the command:
g++ assignment3.cpp -o assignment3 -lpthread and
then run it by using the command:
./assignment3 <NUMBER>, where <NUMBER> is the number of threads.

My submission is as expected. In this assignment I used my BTS notes from
CPSC 131 (Data Structure) class in order to implement BST creation,
BST insertion, and BST in order traversal.
