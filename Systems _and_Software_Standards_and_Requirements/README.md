Project: ABC Inc. executives decide to develop an online direct store to increase sales and revenues.  
The ABC Online Direct Store will allow potential customers to search for products, check the price for 
specific products, and check the number of products available for purchase and allow them to make purchases
 directly through the Online Direct Store.  In the future, the online store may open for third party small 
vendors to sell product through the online store.  

Part I: Develop the Vision and Scope Document 
      As a team of business analysts at ABC Inc., you have been assigned to          
      prepare a Vision and Scope document for this project.

Part II: Develop user requirements and the Software Requirements Specifications (SRS)

Next step, your team will need to work with
user representatives to identify user requirements - describe what the users will  be able to do with the system 
product manager to determine what features to include in the new product

From the user requirements, your team derives the functionality that will let users achieve their goals. 

Your team will need to capture the functional and nonfunctional requirements (quality attributes and constraints) 
in the SRS for the developers to design solutions.
