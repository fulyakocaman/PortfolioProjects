Hi! My name is Fulya Kocaman. I have started programming in the last three years and completed my Master of Science degree in Computer Science in May 2022. <p>
I have found my passion when solving a programming problem, working analytically with data, researching, and learning a new set of skills.  <p>
My extensive teaching experience in mathematics and statistics at community colleges has provided me with excellent communication skills, both verbally and written, and made me a great team player. <p>
  
I am a detail-oriented, well-organized, resourceful, and disciplined individual, and looking forward to applying these skills I have developed over the years in the industry.
